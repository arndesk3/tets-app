This example application runs a small Express server. The repository now includes a simple Playwright script.

## Playwright example

1. Install dependencies (Playwright is required):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install playwright
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   npm run playwright
   ```
   The script opens `https://example.com` in a headless Chromium browser and prints the page title.
